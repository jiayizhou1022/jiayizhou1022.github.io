Hi! My name is **Jiayi Zhou**. 

My bachelor's degree is in Environmental Science from the University of Reading and Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (2019-2023). Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Environmental Science at Fudan University (2023-2026).

In my scientific journey, I have made various attempts and gradually accumulated experience. My research exploration began during my undergraduate studies, where I was inspired by the courses I took. This led me to initiate my first research project, where I designed and built my own experimental setup, wrote a patent, and led a team to participate in several competitions, earning some awards. Over time, I gradually embarked on my research path. Initially, I conducted experiments in the field of catalysis. Later, during my leadership of a college innovation training project, I developed an interest in atmospheric chemistry, which led me to join a research group focused on atmospheric chemistry models and emission inventories. **My undergraduate thesis focused on the study of motor vehicle carbon emission inventories**.

After graduating with top honors, I was admitted to Fudan University as a graduate student, where I joined a research group that primarily focuses on atmospheric chemistry experiments. **Here, I explored new areas in atmospheric chemistry experiments, instrument improvement, eddy calculation, model simulation, and the application of machine learning**.

In terms of my personal life, I am a relatively introverted person, but can be quite outgoing in social situations. I enjoy quiet, focused environments and draw strength from solitude, reading, and physical activity. I have been swimming for over ten years and have a strong passion for various sports.

**I am currently applying for a PhD program**. If you are interested in learning more, please contact me via email (**23210740028@m.fudan.edu.cn**). My research journey has been deeply enriched by the guidance and support of many mentors, for which I am very grateful. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Professors Chenxi Li, Haiwei Li, Hao Zhou, Lei Yao, Lin Wang, Nan Li, Qing Li, Runlong Cai, Weiwei Hu, Xinlei Gai, and Zhiguo Yu for their invaluable mentorship.
