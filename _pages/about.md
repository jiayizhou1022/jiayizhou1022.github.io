Hi! My name is **Jiayi Zhou**. 

My research interests include **atmospheric chemistry experiments, field experiments, flux calculation, model simulation, and the application of machine learning**. By exploring the underlying mechanisms of atmospheric processes, I aim to contribute to advancing knowledge in this field and address relevant environmental challenges. Currently **I am applying for a PhD program**. If you would like to know more, please contact me via email (**23210740028@m.fudan.edu.cn**).
